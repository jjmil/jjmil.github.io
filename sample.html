    <h1>Is ‘Chia Seed Water’ Good for You?</h4>
    <p>Social media proponents claim it has digestive and weight loss benefits. Here’s what experts
        think.</p>
    <p><img src="graphics/gangster_spongebob.png"></p>
    <p><p1>When asked if any studies had examined whether chia seeds could reduce
        constipation, the experts said they weren’t aware of any. But there’s good research in
        general showing that dietary fiber — an essential nutrient abundant in chia seeds — can
        help.</p1></p>
    <p><p1>A two-tablespoon serving of dry chia seeds contains nearly 10 grams of fiber. That’s
        more than twice the amount in a medium Red Delicious apple, and a good portion of the
        recommended 21 to 38 grams most people should eat each day.</p1></p>
